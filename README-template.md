## My process
I accidentally started with the desktop version again, but with this card layout it didn't really seem to make much difference. I used a max-width media-query to account for changes to the background for mobile. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I got to practice what I've been learning about grid, and starting to understand padding and margins a little more (don't know why those have stopped me up so much!).

### Continued development

Definitely need to keep working on the transitions of mobile to desktop and what is included in that!
